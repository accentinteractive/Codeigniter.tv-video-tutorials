h1. A single app for development, staging and production

Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to keep different config files for your development, staging and production server? No more mix-ups, lost config files or sudden crashes after an uncareful deployment?

The answer lies in dynamically seting your environment variable, and using it to decide which settings to use. Simple but effective.

Before CI 2.0.1, we had to build this in ourselves. Luckily, it's been built into CI from 2.0.1. Even though actual implementation still requires some handywork.

This quicktip takes you through all the steps.
