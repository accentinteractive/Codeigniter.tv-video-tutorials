Wouldn't it be great if you could create a number of image thumbnails, all in different sizes and aspect ratios, nicely cropped from the center? We will create a library extension that does just that!

This library extension is great for image galleries, CMS-es and so on. In short: for all applications in which you need to be able to display an image in different sizes.

* Do you need to show all images in a 16/9 ratio on your image gallery? No sweat!
* Do you want an 800px and a 120px square thumb for your image gallery? No problema, amigo!
* Do you wish to build your own Flickr clone, and do you need to store 7 thumbnail sizes, all in different aspect ratios? That'll cost you, I'll have to write a whole 12 lines of code!
